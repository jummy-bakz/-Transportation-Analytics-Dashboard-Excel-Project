# 🚍 Transportation Analytics Dashboard – Excel Project

## 🔎 Project Overview
This dashboard was created to uncover hidden inefficiencies and untapped opportunities in a city transportation system using real-world inspired data. Through Excel visualizations, we track passenger behavior, bus utilization, and route performance—translating complex data into clear, actionable strategies.

📊 Tools Used:
Excel, DAX, Data Modeling, Data Cleaning, Data Storytelling

✅ Key Business Questions Addressed
Why did ridership drop by 83.5% in just one month?

Which routes are over/underutilized, and how can we rebalance?

What time of day and day of week sees the most/least usage?

Are there untapped rider groups (e.g. students, retirees)?

How can data drive decisions to optimize fleet and pricing?
